# Thank you

Thank you for providing me an opportunity with the assignment

### Few assumptions I made to complete the task:

1. I used a mock API(I used this platform https://api.npoint.io/ to create a fake end point) to fetch the required JSON from an API
2. I used latest react hooks for state creation and data fetching.
3. I used [react-responsive-carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel) to create the carousel component, initially I thought to create this component from the scratch using the transform3d and transition properties of the CSS and moving the slide on left and right click, then I was running into issues with responsiveness and accessibility. I figured that this was taking a lot of time and then I started looking for third party libraries.
4. I used create-react-app package to create the boilerplate and built on top of it.
5. I used @testing-library which is my favorite for unit testing because how it tests the functionality over the implementation
6. I appropriately added aria-label and tab-indexes for accessibility users
7. I used all latest ES6 features by let,const, string literals, de-structuring, arrow functions where ever necessary
8. I used plain CSS with inline styling for state depended styles, but a [styled Component](https://styled-components.com/) would be nice to have, then I thought it would be a overkill for a small use case.
9. I added testId for automation frameworks to pick for automation testing.
