Welcome to the Williams-Sonoma Coding Challenge

Using the json file provided below, given an input of products, design a page that:

· Consumes the JSON of products

· Builds the product details page with all products

· Displays the product details, including price, product name and the main hero image

· Interacts intuitivley; if you click on the image, you should see an overlay with a carousal of all thumbnail images

JSON URL - https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json

Guidelines

· Use any view framework of your choice

· As much as possible, stick to vanilla JavaScript for DOM handling (queries, events, etc.)

· Spend your time in design and implementation. We are not looking for the quickest solution.

· Detail your build system and tests in README.md – how do we run the tests and run the project?

· Showcase your ES6 skills and your UX/UI chops.

Bonus

· Responsive experience – 1 column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop

· Accessibility and SEO
